This repository contains the `clangcrunchcc' compiler wrapper, some tests, and
`envsetup.sh'.

There are many dependencies though.

The easiest way to get everything is using Google's `repo' tool:

Download it:
$ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$ chmod +x ~/bin/repo

Download clangcrunch and all its dependencies, including clang and LLVM:
$ mkdir $PROJECT_DIR && cd $PROJECT_DIR
$ repo init -u https://github.com/chrisdiamand/clangcrunch_manifest.git
$ repo sync

Alternatively, all the repositories that I modified or wrote can be downloaded
directly from github:
$ git clone https://github.com/chrisdiamand/clangcrunch.git
$ git clone https://github.com/chrisdiamand/llvm.git
$ cd llvm/tool/ && git clone https://github.com/chrisdiamand/clang.git
# These last four are forks of Stephen Kell's projects
$ git clone https://github.com/chrisdiamand/libcrunch.git
$ git clone https://github.com/chrisdiamand/liballocs.git
$ git clone https://github.com/chrisdiamand/dwarfidl.git
$ git clone https://github.com/chrisdiamand/libdwarfpp.git

libcrunch has several other dependencies - these can be downloaded from
https://github.com/stephenrkell

As a last resort, patches containing the changes I made to each project are
included in the patches/ directory.
