Subject: Phase 1 - Diamand: A functional language targeting the LLVM

Phase 1 Project Selection Status Report

Name: Chris Diamand

College: King's

User Identifier: cd493

Director of Studies: Tim Griffin

Please complete 1, 2 and 3 below.

1. Please write 100 words on your current project ideas.

One of:
 - A compiler frontend targeting LLVM, for example for a
   functional language, with Hindley-Milner type inference as an
   extension goal.

 - The "Faster TTC" project suggested by the Computer
   Architecture group for 2013/2014. This would involve adding
   features like pipelining and branch prediction (and more as
   time allows) to the TTC CPU design used in the IB ECAD
   practicals, then evaluation the resulting performance change.

2. Please list names of potential project supervisors.

I have spoken to David Chisnall and Stephen Kell about their
project ideas involving LLVM. If I chose the TTC projects, I
would contact Simon Moore.

3. Is there any chance that your project will involve any
computing resources other than the Computing Service's MCS and
software that is already installed there, for example: your own
machine, machines in College, special peripherals, imported
software packages, special hardware, network access, substantial
extra disc space on the MCS.

If so indicate below what, and what it is needed for.

The compiler project would require no extra software (LLVM and
ML compilers are already installed on the MCS).

The TTC project would require:
 - A tPad FPGA board
 - Access to Bluespec and Altera tools
 - Ideally, access to the above tools on my local machine, which
   would greatly increase compilation speed.
